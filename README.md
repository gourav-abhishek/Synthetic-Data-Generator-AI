# Synthetic-Data-Generator-AI


## Overview
This is a AI web application that generates high-quality synthetic datasets for sensitive domains including Healthcare, Finance, and Autonomous Vehicles. **It leverages advanced generative AI models (CTGAN, TVAE, and Statistical Synthesizer) to create realistic synthetic data when real data is scarce or restricted**.
